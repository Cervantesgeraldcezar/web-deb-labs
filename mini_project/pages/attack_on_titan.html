      <h2>About Attack on Titan</h2>
      <p>Attack on Titan, written by Hajime Isayama, is a dark fantasy manga and anime series set in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction. Humans live within enormous walled cities to protect themselves from giant humanoid creatures known as Titans, who devour humans without reason. The story begins with Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert as they join the military after their home is destroyed by a Titan attack. What starts as a fight for survival soon reveals deeper mysteries about the Titans, the walls, and the world beyond. Known for its intense action, shocking plot twists, and exploration of freedom, war, and morality, Attack on Titan became a cultural phenomenon. The series pushes readers and viewers to question the cost of survival and the true nature of humanity itself.</p>
